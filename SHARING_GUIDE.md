## Option 2: Cloud Storage (Quick & Easy)

### Google Drive / OneDrive / Dropbox
1. Zip the entire folder:

   - Right-click → "Send to" → "Compressed (zipped) folder"
2. Upload the ZIP to Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox
3. Share the link with your group members
4. They download and unzip to view

**Files to include:**
- index.html

## Option 3: Email Attachment

1. Zip all files (same as Option 2)
2. Attach ZIP file to email
3. Send to group members

⚠️ **Note:** Some email providers have size limits (usually 25MB). Our files are tiny, so this should work fine!

## Option 4: USB Drive / Shared Folder

If working on same network or in person:
- Copy the entire folder to USB drive
- Or copy to shared network folder
- Group members copy to their computers

## What Group Members Need to Do:

1. **Download/Clone** the files
2. **Unzip** (if downloaded as ZIP)
3. **Open `index.html`** in any web browser
4. That's it! No server needed - works directly from files
